=========== TODAY
* report on chib scores for NIPS, huffpost
* * show for each method typical K and typical Ebeta

* plot K vs nLap, ELBO vs nLap for bnpy runs
* * compare tau=0.1 to 0.01, HDPM to HDPPE

* make figure of predictive likelihood vs. K at several different checkpoints

* speed up births? speed up merges more?

=========== Stochastic
* better computation of the evidence bound (avg across batches)

=========== need4speed
* move to completely vectorized obsmodel for BagOfWords

=========== Long-Term
* Logging
* * separate log transcripts for births/merges, so we can do detailed diagnostics?
