========== verify evidence
* change to equalAtMSigFigs

========== Learn.py
return structure that allows inspecting the
* evBound : final ev bound
* evTrace :  nLap x 1 vector of ev bound at each step
* random other fields?

========== Learn.py seeds
* use only first 5 characters of jobname as seed? or until the first non-alpha character

========== Births
* only perform if K < Kmax
*    force Kfresh = min(Kfresh, Kmax-K) so that we always stay under Kmax

========== SuffStatDict

Redesign, with
* simpler internal structure (don't hide behind __dict__)
* direct access to fields.  Don't use dictionary notation at all.
* smarter handling of field dimensions. What happens in singleton case should be very well-defined.

=========== Logging
have separate log transcripts for births/merges, so we can do detailed diagnostics?

=========== Tests
For each model:
*** verify inits are repeatable
*** verify that moVB with nBatch=1 is same as VB
*** verify that soVB with nBatch=1,rhoexp=0 is same as VB
*** verify that soVB, moVB, and VB end up at similar ballparks for ELBO vals
