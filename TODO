=========== TODAY
* report on chib scores for NIPS, bars_normal, bars_bursty
* * show for each method typical K and typical Ebeta

=========== Memoized
* adjust converge threshold to maximize perf when memoLP=0
* consider setting maxTargetSize larger for births? maybe 1000 documents?

=========== Stochastic
* better computation of the evidence bound (avg across batches)

=========== need4speed
* move to completely vectorized obsmodel for BagOfWords
* merges
* * faster selection of next component (maybe just try all of them??)
* * only update obsmodel for new component!
* births
* * avoid computing ELBO when not necessary




=========== LONG-Term
* Logging
* * separate log transcripts for births/merges, so we can do detailed diagnostics?
