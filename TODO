=========== data
better synthetic data, with realistic vocab scale, but reasonable (10 or 20) number of topics

vocab_size = 10000
K = 20

"cube"
3 faces, each with 2 orientations
= x6 multiplier

suppose we have B bars on a single side
then we have 6*B^2 total topics (assuming all are used)

setting B=2 gives 24 total topics
setting B=3 gives 54 total topics

total of cuberoot(V) words on a side.  if we did V=8000, then side-length=20

=========== births
* are we redundantly adding topics? should we merge in the expanded model?


=========== merges
* log_merge_move is expensive! need to get rid of it? DONE (via doWriteLog merge flag)

=========== ObsModel
* move to completely vectorized obsmodel for BagOfWords

=========== AllocModel
* HDPFull : better optimization for u based on reparameterization of its Beta distr

* HDPFull : full posterior for both v and r
* HDPPE : full posterior for r, 
* HDPFullHard : full posterior for v, hard assignments for r
* HDPPEHard : point estimates for v, hard assignments for r

=========== Stochastic
* better computation of the evidence bound (avg across batches)

=========== LOGGING

DataSet/allocModel/obsModel/infAlg/jobname/taskid/
vs
Dataset/jobname/taskid/ [with maybe reset default behavior to not overwrite previous run if done by different allocModel/obsModel??]
