======== Birth Move

after trying a birth move at comp k:
  if fails (nothing new created): 
    prob try again should be extremely low

  if succeeds (some new comps created): 
    should not try again until 2 or 3 laps done

newborn component:
  probably should not be tried until at least one lap is complete

merged component:
  probably should not be tried until at least a few laps are complete
