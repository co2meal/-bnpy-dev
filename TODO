=========== births
* are we redundantly adding topics? should we merge in the expanded model?

=========== merges
* log_merge_move is expensive! need to get rid of it?

=========== ObsModel
* move to completely vectorized obsmodel for BagOfWords

=========== AllocModel
* HDPFull : better optimization for u based on reparameterization of its Beta distr

* HDPFull : full posterior for both v and r
* HDPPE : full posterior for r, 
* HDPFullHard : full posterior for v, hard assignments for r
* HDPPEHard : point estimates for v, hard assignments for r

=========== Stochastic
* better computation of the evidence bound (avg across batches)

=========== LOGGING

DataSet/allocModel/obsModel/infAlg/jobname/taskid/
vs
Dataset/jobname/taskid/ [with maybe reset default behavior to not overwrite previous run if done by different allocModel/obsModel??]
