======== Data
standardize to using proper Data object throughout


======== Local Params
keep as a dict??

for mix models:
  LP['resp']
for admix models
  LP['resp'], LP['groupWeights'], LP['NperGroup']
for HMMs
  LP['resp'], LP['respPair']

======== Suff Stats
SS object should just be an information container.

All logic should happen in the model specification.

SSlist : list of SS components.

can delete, add, reorder, etc. at will!
