========== REORGANIZATION

Move "executables" inside of bnpy module.

Example new syntax:
  python -m bnpy.Run AsteriskK8 DPMixModel Gauss VB [opts]

Example
  python -m bnpy.PlotELBO [args
  python -m bnpy.PlotComps [args]

========== Learn.py

Improve automatic help with "--help" argument

Allow "restarting" existing runs from custom lap, with all same settings and reproducible random seeds
 * should it save in the same directory?
 * edit LearnAlgs to have rand-seed reset at each lap, with "startLap" as input arg

Save files should use "Lap102.45-AllocModel.mat" as the desired format.

========== SuffStatDict

Redesign, with
* simpler internal structure (don't hide behind __dict__)
* direct access to fields.  Don't use dictionary notation at all.
* smarter handling of field dimensions. What happens in singleton case should be very well-defined.

=========== Logging
have separate log transcripts for births/merges, so we can do detailed diagnostics?
