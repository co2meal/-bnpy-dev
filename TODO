=========== BEFORE RELEASE
* size instead of nObs for Data??

* stdout: how much to display for births/merges??  Set verbosity level??

* lots of documentation!!?!!

* clean up topic model code???

=========== LONG-Term
* Logging
have separate log transcripts for births/merges, so we can do detailed diagnostics?
