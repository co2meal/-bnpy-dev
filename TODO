========== SuffStatDict

Redesign, with
* simpler internal structure (don't hide behind __dict__)
* direct access to fields.  Don't use dictionary notation at all.
* smarter handling of field dimensions. What happens in singleton case should be very well-defined.

=========== Logging
have separate log transcripts for births/merges, so we can do detailed diagnostics?

=========== Tests
For each model:
*** verify inits are repeatable
*** verify that moVB with nBatch=1 is same as VB
*** verify that soVB with nBatch=1,rhoexp=0 is same as VB
*** verify that soVB, moVB, and VB end up at similar ballparks for ELBO vals
