PROFILE why births take so long
FIX brown grid so that computation is fast

move to completely vectorized obsmodel for BagOfWords

=========== Topic Model algos
* verify what's lost by moVB with and without memoizing the LP
* better unit tests for birth moves

* write-up with good notation, description of merge computations

=========== Topic Model Viz

* better averaging over soVB ELBO plots (running average?)

=========== LONG-Term
* Logging
have separate log transcripts for births/merges, so we can do detailed diagnostics?
