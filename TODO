=========== TESTS

=========== SPEED AND GRACEFUL FALLBACK
perform some automatic quick tests to decide if 
  numexpr is better than numpy for different tasks

=========== births
* are we redundantly adding topics? should we merge in the expanded model?

=========== AllocModel
* HDPFull : better optimization for u based on reparameterization of its Beta distr

=========== Stochastic
* better computation of the evidence bound (avg across batches)
* what are the correct updates for v* from the point estimate HDP?

=========== LOGGING
DataSet/allocModel/obsModel/infAlg/jobname/taskid/
vs
Dataset/jobname/taskid/ [with maybe reset default behavior to not overwrite previous run if done by different allocModel/obsModel??]
