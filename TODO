========== Births
* only perform if K < Kmax
*    force Kfresh = min(Kfresh, Kmax-K) so that we always stay under Kmax

========== SuffStatDict

Redesign, with
* simpler internal structure (don't hide behind __dict__)
* direct access to fields.  Don't use dictionary notation at all.
* smarter handling of field dimensions. What happens in singleton case should be very well-defined.

=========== Logging
have separate log transcripts for births/merges, so we can do detailed diagnostics?
