Tests of parallelization.

* kmeans/
  Legacy code for some of the first experiments on shared-memory parallelization.
  See https://bitbucket.org/michaelchughes/bnpy-dev/pull-request/31/

* benchmark/
  Benchmark to understand how well different tasks (sleep, matrix multiply, etc.)
  lend themselves to shared-memory parallelization.

  Usage 
  -----
  python benchmark/RunBenchmark --task sleep --nWorkers 1,2,4 --methods all

* topics/
  Some unit-tests to verify correct parallelization of local step of topic models.

* hmm/
  Some unit-tests to verify correctness of paralellized local step for HMMs.
